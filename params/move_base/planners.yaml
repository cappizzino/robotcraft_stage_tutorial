  # Specifies whether or not to allow the planner to create plans that traverse unknown space. NOTE: if you are using a layered costmap_2d costmap with a voxel or obstacle layer, you must also set the track_unknown_space param for that layer to be true, or it will convert all your unknown space to free space (which planner will then happily go right through).
